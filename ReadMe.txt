Minmax Heuristic:-
The function evalBoard() in the controller takes a player and returns the sum of distances of each player piece to the furthest 
vertex of the goal reigon ([0, 12] for Human, and [16, 12] for AI)

The minmax function evaluates state of the board by subtracting human's score and AI score and returns
so a negative state signfies a bad state for AI as human is closer to goal than AI in that case and vice verca
